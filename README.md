# Spring 2024, CS3200 (Database Design) Project 1

```
Problem: For stores (especially local stores like Asian grocery stores) in a neighborhood/city without online platforms, it is hard for the user to know which store sells something for the cheapest price.
Solution: An application where users can upload prices of common things whenever they go to any store. Other users can then see the prices/unit for each store, and they can then decide where to go. It will also have features that will help the user discover the best prices. Basically, it's crowdsourced price tracking for offline stores.
Potential Tables:
- Stores
- Users (login system)
- Items
- Geolocation (location of the stores)
- categories
(more to be added, I will add stuff as I go)
Current tech stack plan - node+express+react+sqlite+js
